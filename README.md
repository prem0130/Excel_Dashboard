This project focuses on analyzing transactional data from Vrinda Store to derive meaningful business insights. The dataset comprises various metrics such as order dates, product categories, sales values, customer details, and payment methods. The primary objective is to evaluate sales performance, understand product demand trends, and uncover patterns in customer behavior over a period of time.

Using Microsoft Excel as the main tool, the data was first cleaned and organized to ensure consistency and accuracy. Techniques such as sorting, filtering, and conditional formatting were applied to enhance data visibility. Pivot tables were extensively used to summarize data across multiple dimensions like product categories, months, and customer segments.

Several interactive dashboards and charts were created to visually represent key insights. These include monthly revenue trends, top-performing products, least selling items, and sales distribution across regions or cities. The analysis also highlights peak sales periods and identifies customer purchase patterns that can help optimize marketing strategies.

This project is particularly useful for retail businesses aiming to track performance and make data-driven decisions. It demonstrates core analytical skills, strong attention to detail, and the ability to transform raw data into actionable intelligence. Future improvements may include automating the reporting process or integrating Power BI for more dynamic visualizations. This repository reflects a solid foundation in Excel-based analytics and a keen interest in data science.
